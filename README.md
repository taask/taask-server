# Taask Core

:wave: Welcome!

Taask Core is an open source system for running arbitrary jobs on any infrastructure. In other words, `cloud native tasks-as-a-service`.

## What does Taask Core do?
- :white_check_mark: Runs arbitrary workloads (tasks) written in any language
- :white_check_mark: Runs those tasks in a fault tolerant way
- :white_check_mark: Operates with no single point of failure
- :white_check_mark: Operates on any infrastructure
- :white_check_mark: Keeps task data encrypted, in transit and at rest

## What doesn't it do?
- :no_entry_sign: Act as a message bus
- :no_entry_sign: Replace Kubernetes
- :no_entry_sign: Orchestrate servers

## But is it serverless?
That depends on your definition, but in general, no. If you deploy the control plane and autoscale it, and use a runner that delegates to containers (such as runner-k8s), then it resembles serverless since it scales to 0 and allows for usage-based compute.

More precisely, Taask Core is a Functions-as-a-service platform that is tuned towards heavy, long-running workloads. Taask does stand for "Tasks as a service... k", after all :smile:

## Project status
:warning: Taask is in *pre-Alpha* and should not be used for critical workloads. When all critical components have been implemented, and the platform's security has been fully reviewed, it will graduate to alpha.

Taask Core has three goals:
- Security
- Reliability
- Speed

Taask Core will not graduate to alpha until its security has been proven. It will not graduate to beta until its reliability has been proven. It will not graduate to stable until it has been further optimized for production traffic without compromising security or reliability. This is the guiding principle the project follows.

## Components
Taask Core is comprised of three components:
- taask-server (this project)
- runners
- clients

And optional components:
- Service mesh (linkerd by default - for obervability and transport security)
- Prometheus (for metrics collection)
- Grafana (for metrics visualization)
- EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana - for aggregated logging)

```

### Server
The Taask Core server (this project) is the main component of the Taask control plane.
It is responsible for consuming tasks, tracking their state, and scheduling them onto the compute plane.
taask-server operates in a "managing partner" cluster. Multiple instances work together to share management tasks and remain fault-tolerant.
Clients can communicate with any instance of taask-server, and the tasks they produce will be distributed across the partners and their runners.
Runners register themselves with individual instances of taask-server.

### Runners
The Taask compute plane is comprised of one or more runners. Runners register themselves with taask-server to make themselves available for tasks.
Runners communicate with taask-server using gRPC, and bi-directionally stream data for optimal performance.
Tasks are scheduled to runners, they are executed, and the results returned.
Runners can be written in any language using first-party and third-party runner libraries.

- [runner-k8s](https://github.com/taask/runner-k8s): Runs tasks as Kubernetes Jobs using container images
- [runner-golang](https://github.com/taask/runner-golang): Go library for developing custom runners

### Child Runners
Runners such as runner-k8s can delegate tasks to _child runners_, which are short-lived, ephemeral runners meant to execute one task in their lifetime.

### Clients
Clients generate tasks, which are arbitrary JSON, and send them to taask-server to be executed.
Clients can stream task status updates from taask-server.
Clients encrypt task data before submitting them, ensuring tasks are never transmitted or stored in a decrypted state.

- [client-golang](https://github.com/taask/client-golang): Go library for producing tasks and communicating with taask-server

### Tasks
Tasks are arbitrary JSON. Clients produce tasks, runners use the task JSON as input for their `Run` function, and return arbitrary result JSON.

### Security
Security is the top priority for Taask Core. The details on the authentication and encryption scheme used by Taask can be found in the [security readme](auth/README.md).
